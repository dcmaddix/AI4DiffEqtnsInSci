# Call for Papers

We welcome all original research papers of up to **4 pages** in length. This length does not include
references or any supplementary materials. Reviewers are *not* obliged
to read supplementary materials when reviewing the paper.  Submissions
should be a single file in `.pdf` format using [this style file](assets/iclr2024.zip). The review process is
*double-blind*, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately
anonymized. We reserve the right to desk-reject improperly-anonymized
papers.

This workshop is **non-archival**; even though all accepted papers will be
available on OpenReview, there are *no* formally-published proceedings.

# Scope and topics

We invite all submissions on using machine learning to solve differential equations with applications in science and engineering.

Key topics include but are not limited to:
- Exploration of novel applications of deep learning techniques in scientific simulations of partial or ordinary differential equations.
- Forward and inverse problems in PDEs to equation discovery, design optimization, and beyond, to witness the diverse applications of AI in scientific pursuits. 
- Explainability and interpretability of AI models in scientific contexts.

If you are not sure if your topic is suitable for the workshop, please feel free to contact any of the organizers.
